# to-do-list
The  basic idea for this Web application is to create and delete our task/job as per our choice. We will use HTML to structure it and CSS (again it is totally optional), and javascript to provide functionality like adding or removing tasks from the list. We created 3 files: index.html, style.css, todo.js
